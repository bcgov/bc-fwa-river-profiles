River Elevation Profiles (British Columbia)
========================

### Usage

Note: Must have your own DEM (e.g. TRIM, SRTM, ALOS DSM, ASTER GDEM, etc.). 

There is currently one script that maps the elevation profile of a river based on the river name.

-   R\1_Script.R

The goal is to develop this into an R package.
